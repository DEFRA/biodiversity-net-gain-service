                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Introduction</h2>
                <p class="govuk-body">The statutory biodiversity credit scheme is run by Natural England on behalf of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) as part of the Environment Act 2021.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">The scheme enables developers or landowners to purchase credits if they are unable to meet their BNG (Biodiversity Net Gain) obligation. This could be either through on-site, off-site on other landholdings, or by purchasing biodiversity units.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">The credits will go towards achieving their BNG obligation.</p>
                
                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Not transferable</h2>
                <p class="govuk-body">The issued Statutory Biodiversity Credits may not be sold, transferred or moved to any third party (whether a person, company or other organisation).</p>
                
                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Liability</h2>
                <p class="govuk-body">It is your responsibility to ensure you have purchased the correct number, and tier, of Statutory Biodiversity Credits to meet your BNG obligation.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Full terms and conditions can be found in <a href="#">guidance</a>.</p>
