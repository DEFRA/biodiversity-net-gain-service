      <p>This accessibility statement applies to content published on the <a href="https://manage-biodiversity-gains.defra.gov.uk">manage-biodiversity-gains.defra.gov.uk</a> domain.</p>

      <p>This website is run by Natural England. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
        <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
        <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We've also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>

      <p><a href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/">AbilityNet</a> has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How accessible this website is</h2>

      <p>The service uses common styles, patterns and components from the GOV.UK Design System, which are widely regarded as accessible.</p>

      <p>We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible.</p>

      <p>The colour contrast of the white text against the blue background colour on the tag element fails to meet WCAG 2.1 guidelines for contrast enhanced. This issue may affect you if you have low vision. You may have difficulty in distinguishing the text against the blue background colour.</p>

      <p>The 'Change' links in the description list are non-descriptive and duplicated. This may be problematic if you're a screen reader user using the links dialogue list as it's not clear what will be changed if the links are activated.</p>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Feedback and contact information</h2>
